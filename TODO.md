- Make HTML UI indicate which objects are the same object and which ones are different.
- Enable capture and rendering of the _names_ of function arguments on the call stack. (Requires the creation of a `ReflectionFunctionAbstract` for the called function/method.)
- Make `unknown type` show as plain black text in the HTML UI.
- Make `INF`, `-INF` and `NAN` show in blue like other kinds of numbers.
